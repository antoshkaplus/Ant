# undir_*
graph description:
number of vertices, starting from 0
adjacent vertices


# test_bfs_* correspond to undir_*
first line number of test cases
each test case consists of:
- starting vertex
- (n-1) pairs, vertex where we came, time, starting vertex at 0

# flow
first line: node count, edge count
edges follow: from, to, dist
max flow result follows
